All files in this folder (except for this README) are part of the builtin dnd_5e_builtin module

To make changes to this module, copy the folder and rename it to something else but dnd_5e_builtin!
Otherwise all changes will be overwritten on the next program start!

Using the _builtin postfix on custom modules is possible, but i highly advise against it as module IDs might change in a future release and 
as such may overwrite your custom modules if the filenames happen to conflict!

Feel free to use this module as a base for your own module creations

Mandatory files are:
- moduleInfo.json
- shared.css
- *.json, *.css, *.csv for all sheets defined in moduleInfo.json (Make sure filenames match!)
